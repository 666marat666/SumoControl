# SumoControl
Simple node app to control the Jumping Sumo from Parrot.
(I prefer arrows instead of moving my iPad...)

To install, run :
- npm install

To run :
- connect to the drone wifi
- run : node index.js

Then connect to http://127.0.0.1:3000 in Chrome.
Use the arrow keys to move your drone, space for high jump, shift for tap and the left button ont the page for other moves.
